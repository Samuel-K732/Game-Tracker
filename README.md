Game Tracker is an application designed for gamers who enjoy organizing and keeping track of their completed games. It allows users to store and edit detailed records of completed games. The project is built using CustomTkinter for the graphical user interface and SQLAlchemy for managing the database. In the future, an enhanced interface style will be added to improve the user experience.
