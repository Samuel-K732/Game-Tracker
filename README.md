# Game Tracker
Game Tracker is an application designed for gamers who enjoy organizing and keeping track of their completed games. It allows users to store and edit detailed records. The project is built using CustomTkinter for the graphical user interface and SQLAlchemy for managing the database. 
Please note that this project is still in its early stages and may contain bugs or unfinished features.

To start using the application, simply run the game_tracker.exe file.

To add your first entry, click the Add Entry button and fill out the form. Please note that fields such as Title, Review (with "Bad" as the default value), and Time Spent are mandatory.

To edit an already added entry, select it from the dropdown list and click the Edit Entry button. In the new window, you can modify the entry or delete it completely.

If, for any reason, you have created many unnecessary or erroneous entries, you can go to the Options menu and select Delete All Data to completely clear the database and start fresh. More functionality will be added to the Options menu in future updates.

Enjoy using the app!
